A solution representation of genetic algorithm for neural network weights and structure

This paper presents a new solution representation for genetic algorithm to optimize the
neural network model. During the optimization process, the weights, biases and structure
of the neural network are considered for altering. The quality of the model is examined
by a cost function that deliberates over both minimization of error and complexity of
the neural network model. The performance of the proposed method is investigated by
applying it on two time series prediction problems. The results show promising results
when we compare it with other methods in the literature
